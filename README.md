Welcome to my Coronavirus React application.

I've worked in React in the past, and moved over heavily into Vue the past 2+ years. In that time, I used Nuxt.js which is based off of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). This project is for me to reintroduce myself into the React environment while using some current world issue.

## Technologies
* React
* Next
* Highcharts
* Bootstrap
* AWS S3 deployment with Cloudfront

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Static Site Deployment
```
npm run build
npm run export
cd out
serve -p 8080
```
